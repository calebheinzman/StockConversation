11/18/2019 16:55:58,i normally wait for the 3rd high for the day before i short
11/18/2019 16:55:59,the bounce at 10:45 happened because people went short anticipating break down at 53 support but covered when it held and that caused the squee up
11/18/2019 16:56:20,squeeze
11/18/2019 16:57:09,<@!628387089985306624> I am on Schwab
11/18/2019 16:57:11,Short KXTC at close
11/18/2019 16:57:21,or KRTX* lol
11/18/2019 16:57:44,I was thinking NXTC lol
11/18/2019 16:58:15,theres no reason why it cant gap up 20% over night
11/18/2019 16:58:44,shorting at close is gambling . successful traders dont gamble
11/18/2019 17:00:13,can't short KRTX in TOS lol
11/18/2019 17:00:35,TOS is horrible with shares to short
11/18/2019 17:01:06,not knocking TOS ( i use it) but bad for shorting

11/18/2019 11:56:57,I went through that a couple of times, I just need to take notes and play around in this program to familiarize myself with how to navigate it. Ive spent so many hours trying to get everything set up that my brain is just fried lol. Thank you all for the help. This old lady needed some help. It will just take time and effort and I have tons of time and am willing to do whatever it takes. I just ask a lot of questions.
11/18/2019 11:57:44,all good. just take it a step at a time.
11/18/2019 11:57:49,have fun

11/18/2019 12:12:00,How long til UGAZ hits 18 again y’all think?
11/18/2019 12:12:09,which NG chart is everyone using now? I am debating on switching from Z19 but I do not see much difference

11/18/2019 13:54:50,NOAA OUTLOOK will be published this Thursday this could be huge for ugaz if it’s on its favor

11/18/2019 11:51:49,Umm
11/18/2019 01:03:23,We’ll see  if support holds might just be a pullback
11/18/2019 01:05:54,NGG20 looks overbought on the RSI, currently down 1.26%.. wait and see
11/18/2019 01:07:36,UGAZ bouta open green
11/18/2019 01:34:37,why looking at NGG20？ not NGZ2019 ?
11/18/2019 01:42:52,Ngf20
11/18/2019 01:44:01,what show the most volume? i think that would make the most sense to follow

11/18/2019 02:04:25,https://twitter.com/nwspittsburgh/status/1196233423393710080?s=21
11/18/2019 02:40:52,Can I ask a question here to someone who has been doing this a long time? I see ATUS as a potentially good swing trade, as it fits many indicators, but I wanted to ask what someone else thought since i'm new. Thank you so much
11/18/2019 02:49:34,<@637759501272875048> looks like a good set up but its been consolidating pretty hard. If you're willing to hold on to it for the long haul, you could profit from it.
11/18/2019 02:51:50,I just looked at  ATUS it does look interesting. It may have potential, maybe looking into the news for why the price drop might help out with this on.
11/18/2019 02:52:14,It was earnings I belive
11/18/2019 02:53:27,but despite the overreaction the stock has been up for the year.
11/18/2019 02:53:33,the news says "HSBC changed the rating for Altice USA Inc (NYSE:ATUS) from Buy to Hold. In the third quarter, Altice USA showed an EPS of $0.12, compared to $0.04 from the year-ago quarter. The total market value of Altice USA's outstanding shares is at $19.7 billion. The stock has a 52-week-high of $31.78 and a 52-week-low of $15.15. Altice USA's stock last closed at $26.84 per share."
11/18/2019 02:54:27,I would like to see ATUS break thru the EMA a little more, set some alerts.
11/18/2019 02:54:49,<@433387770447265802> couldnt have said it any better
11/18/2019 02:55:11,thats exactly where I put my alerts
11/18/2019 02:55:33,Perfect
11/18/2019 02:56:32,Thank you all for the help I 10/10 appreciate that, when you say set some alerts do you mean for a price change or is there a way to set an alert specifically around EMA change
11/18/2019 02:57:02,Price change
11/18/2019 02:57:14,I already have an alert set at price change to 27.01 which to me would be a positive buy signal
11/18/2019 02:57:22,again thank you so much
11/18/2019 02:59:15,It might have a pull back  at 27.00 just be patience and get in at a pull back.
11/18/2019 04:08:32,For when the hardos wake up in the morning.
11/18/2019 04:19:19,CL resistance at 57.8?

11/17/2019 23:09:56,I missed a big chance day trading UGAZ on Wed and Friday last week
11/17/2019 23:10:30,Been holding ugaz for 2 months it’s just a lifestyle 😂
11/17/2019 23:11:06,I was thinking getting in Thursday morning after the market opens , because it always seems to dip after that <@473695043665002508>

11/17/2019 23:13:54,Ok will do
11/17/2019 23:14:15,It should follow ugaz and dgaz more accurately by now
11/17/2019 23:14:46,because /NG i was expect it to push up and /NG20 I expect it to push down, now I will follow NG20 lol
11/17/2019 23:14:56,at the moment UGAZ and DGAZ should follow NGF20
11/17/2019 23:15:35,https://www.velocityshares.com/etns/product/dgaz/
11/17/2019 23:17:52,Hey guys Im practicing day trading using the on demand feature of thinkorswim. What stock would be good to practice on from this past week?
11/17/2019 23:24:50,<@599462600211693569> UGAZ I did on demand yesterday on UGAZ

11/17/2019 23:26:40,How do you pick stocks that you want to practice on using ondemand?
11/17/2019 23:27:15,No idea what those are
11/17/2019 23:27:21,Im holding 15k shares at 16.58 ugaz   .. 😫
11/17/2019 23:27:25,Once you pick the time you should able to pick any stock and use the Active Trader
11/17/2019 23:27:54,<@482402495101140993> that's a lot of share
11/17/2019 23:28:04,Last week I hold with 100 share
11/17/2019 23:28:43,and it drop and on Monday I make part of it back 1000 share
11/17/2019 23:29:13,Nah im just joking..  not holding anything lol
11/17/2019 23:29:28,lol
11/17/2019 23:30:39,anyone here trade actual futures contracts?
11/17/2019 23:30:51,Dgaz let’s get it! 👍
11/17/2019 23:32:50,I haven’t yet but I was just looking into trading micro e mini futures <@537264977065803806>
11/17/2019 23:33:38,Last week i was down 100 share then scalp the 1000 share
11/17/2019 23:34:43,Looking forward to scalp UGAZ again
11/17/2019 23:34:50,<@482402495101140993> you don’t got that money 😂
11/17/2019 23:41:10,ATEK, CRK and RCM
11/17/2019 23:41:28,This is a win for ugaz
11/17/2019 23:45:27,<@433445304390516736> those are some really quick scalps
11/17/2019 23:48:21,Yes it is
11/17/2019 23:49:10,so  i won't be down so much
11/17/2019 23:50:30,<@142414534764789760> I was holding 100 share and I scalps 1000 share and keep the 100 share
11/17/2019 23:51:02,With this $0 commission it's a good learning for  me lol
11/18/2019 00:05:13,I really thought ng was gonna be up <@506988023381098526>
11/18/2019 00:05:26,Had such a strong day Friday
11/18/2019 00:08:51,<@427684356719378432> I know it was pushing but didn't hold up I think it gonna need a bullish report to break resistance
11/18/2019 00:09:37,Might go down to close the gap I been thinking
11/18/2019 00:09:49,<@427684356719378432>
11/17/2019 23:01:34,so holding was a 50/50 at best
11/17/2019 23:01:46,Nvm I gotta remind myself how I lost half my portfolio this week in the first place -..-
11/17/2019 23:01:53,It was an overall downtrend. With head and shoulder pattern.
11/17/2019 23:02:06,You should swing smaller positions <@!406482262675423233>
11/17/2019 23:02:07,Obvious downtrend ng
11/17/2019 23:02:19,<@473695043665002508> oh yeah I need to also stop going all in on every trade haha
11/17/2019 23:02:23,i just wanna make the biggest bang for my buck
11/17/2019 23:02:41,oh btw <@350163012440686592> should I start calling you daddy
11/17/2019 23:02:53,from 2 weeks ago 😂

11/17/2019 23:03:07,its okay
11/17/2019 23:03:12,this weekend was really important for me
11/17/2019 23:03:26,Normally I hate weekends now because no stocks but I'm actually really happy for weekends this time
11/17/2019 23:03:35,because it gave me a mental break hehe
11/17/2019 23:03:44,I was really nervous 😬
11/17/2019 23:03:45,A much needed one
11/17/2019 23:03:51,Oh did you swing DGAZ?
11/17/2019 23:03:53,over the weekend?
11/17/2019 23:04:00,Me yea
11/17/2019 23:04:04,ohhh lucky you
11/17/2019 23:04:05,40 shares
11/17/2019 23:04:16,I got out before the market closed
11/17/2019 23:04:18,This is the first weekend I didn’t hold UGAZ
11/17/2019 23:04:20,I don't wanna spend all weekend freaking out
11/17/2019 23:04:26,about whether NG would go up or down
11/17/2019 23:04:28,I'm glad I did....
11/17/2019 23:04:31,too much stress
11/17/2019 23:04:39,That’s why I didn’t <@!406482262675423233>
11/17/2019 23:04:46,Yea it kinda sucks holding on the weekend
11/17/2019 23:04:56,<@!406482262675423233> haha
11/17/2019 23:04:56,After last Monday I just couldn’t
11/17/2019 23:05:14,Look like it's going to be a ping pong week for /NG this week
11/17/2019 23:05:27,Until the report
11/17/2019 23:05:53,It's still above the 180 day on 4hour chart
11/17/2019 23:05:56,I should be up 7% on Dgaz
11/17/2019 23:06:19,Based on how the past week was
11/17/2019 23:06:22,just an ups and downs with NG
11/17/2019 23:06:32,plus the fact that we're contending with high supply/cold weather clashing back and forth
11/17/2019 23:06:41,we could probably expect NG to continue what it's been doing last week
11/17/2019 23:06:46,So no one hold overnight 😂
11/17/2019 23:06:57,no clear direction rn
11/17/2019 23:07:02,Now I wanna keep an eye on ROKU

11/17/2019 23:07:41,<@534896389780406313> this week many are expecting a big push on ugaz do to the cold front we got this week
11/17/2019 23:08:15,On the report

11/17/2019 21:21:13,its overbought rn so im waiting for a pull back to 18.58 for a swing
11/17/2019 21:23:44,i think lol
11/17/2019 21:24:36,lol
11/17/2019 21:24:41,i havent looked at it
11/17/2019 21:27:00,yeah i dont know completely yet so
11/17/2019 21:28:36,Anybody have thoughts on uber...  I know the trying self driving cars, but seems more and more people use it.. stock has slumped since going public.. just wondering if anyone has a idea of where the bottom is
11/17/2019 21:30:46,<@408800046600028181> well looking at the fundementals, uber is burning through 500k cash an hour
11/17/2019 21:30:55,so personally im staying far away from it
11/17/2019 21:31:08,they lose money everytime someone orders uber eats
11/17/2019 21:31:08,idunno that sounds like a good option for puts
11/17/2019 21:31:08,xD
11/17/2019 21:31:21,<@!406482262675423233> yeah fair point
11/17/2019 21:32:01,there isint a previous support to base off of either
11/17/2019 21:32:07,also valid
11/17/2019 21:32:15,another reason to stay away
11/17/2019 21:32:56,unless where its at rn is a support, stay away just cause we dont have any previous numbers to base it off of

11/17/2019 21:45:41,cheers
11/17/2019 22:05:25,On the topic of UBER. Has anyone considered a pairs trade. Short UBER and long LYFT. Would have been a great trade for the past month but. Still could have value from here forward. As a pairs trade it is also independent of overall market direction.
11/17/2019 22:09:13,woah hard gap
11/17/2019 22:09:35,Ng will follow?
11/17/2019 22:09:55,Hope not.
11/17/2019 22:13:00,most likely
11/17/2019 22:16:41,So ng will probably sell off?
11/17/2019 22:17:47,most likely imo
11/17/2019 22:25:23,What’s imo?
11/17/2019 22:26:10,<@416787577425887246> 'in my opinion'   I believe.
11/17/2019 20:45:40,<@311488598111158273> have you been trading for a long time?
11/17/2019 20:53:02,<@!317149739491786753> nah. i tried trading this last summer and I failed epically. that's was when I was 15 and now i'm 16 which doesn't make much of a difference, but i'm gonna focus on practicing and becoming consistently green on paper trading then, this summer, I should start trading with about 1k.
11/17/2019 20:54:17,thats awesome that you are getting into it so young! wish i did the same thing
11/17/2019 20:54:31,and yeah paper trading definitely helps iron out the kinks
11/17/2019 20:54:54,yeah my goal is to have 2 months straight where im green 25/30-31 days
11/17/2019 20:55:41,since i'm at school during a majority of market hours. i usually come home from school, take a shower then boot up TOS on demand and look at how the market moves that day at 3 times speed
11/17/2019 20:56:40,yeah, i experienced a similar change when i started working, i wasnt around to watch the market during the day so i have to check it out in the evening
11/17/2019 20:56:46,i mostly swing trade now
11/17/2019 20:57:22,yeah i was thinking I could do that because it seems to be easier in the sense that the patterns are more consistent.
11/17/2019 20:57:28,how long have you been trading?

11/17/2019 20:58:23,<@416787577425887246> hahahaha mooning
11/17/2019 20:58:27,i used to day trade in college pretty regularly but i learned how to swing trade before i started working so i could keep making money haha
11/17/2019 20:58:41,<@317149739491786753>harder to swing
11/17/2019 20:58:46,but probably been trading for 3-4 years now
11/17/2019 20:58:59,<@317149739491786753> making alot ? %%%
11/17/2019 20:59:26,<@378396342214459412> depends on market conditions and a lot of other variables, hard to just say one is harder than the other
11/17/2019 20:59:44,Ya its sure but since 3 year its harder
11/17/2019 21:00:18,im making an average amount i would say
11/17/2019 21:00:45,You know how much in %?
11/17/2019 21:01:22,on my swings i aim for 7-10% usually
11/17/2019 21:01:30,but sometimes i take risks and stoploss out
11/17/2019 21:01:34,and sometimes i make 30%
11/17/2019 21:01:38,just depends
11/17/2019 21:02:01,i want to do trading full time by hopefully 25
11/17/2019 21:02:17,i thought the same thing 3 years ago lol
11/17/2019 21:02:19,so i got about 10 more years ahead of me to get this all down to a science
11/17/2019 21:02:40,generally you just need a lot of captital to day trade full time
11/17/2019 21:02:57,not saying that its not possible, but it can be tough
11/17/2019 21:03:37,yeah im gonna work a regular job until I've built up enough capital and then when i know that my day trades can match my work income ill quit
11/17/2019 21:03:48,yep
11/17/2019 21:03:51,thats what im doing right now
11/17/2019 21:04:11,if you don't mind me asking, how much capital do you trade with?
11/17/2019 21:04:40,around 10-15k
11/17/2019 21:04:52,You should just use cmeg
11/17/2019 21:04:58,No ptd
11/17/2019 21:05:11,but my swings are usually only 3-4k positions at a time max
11/17/2019 21:05:12,Faster execution than tos
11/17/2019 21:05:49,and the rest is invested in longer term stocks
11/17/2019 21:10:08,yeah
11/17/2019 21:10:31,i have about 1.5k in VOO. I know its not much but i dont really have a job lmao
11/17/2019 21:10:49,Longer term dividend stocks 🙌🙌❤️❤️
11/17/2019 21:11:31,those dividend investors must feel nice when payout day arrives
11/17/2019 21:12:18,yeah i feel you

11/17/2019 17:20:13,Always. When you narrow your focus and really know the trends then your decision making is top notch. I am ahead on Ugaz/DGAZ!

11/17/2019 00:13:40,Hey guys, i’m starting a business on ebay my first 2 months I invested $2000 and received a $3200 return after fees & shipping costs, my question is this a good profit margin, do most companies double their money or would a 60% return be a good investment, it barely takes any of my time just 5m drive to the post office 3 times a week.
11/17/2019 00:16:28,<@205889806180417538> amazing job keep it up

11/17/2019 04:47:47,<@482402495101140993> dm me please
11/17/2019 06:28:12,<@416771541754314752> why are you advertising your damn Shopify account here.
11/17/2019 08:35:03,what a shit product
11/17/2019 12:08:30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP8kK4cUmN8
11/17/2019 14:33:35,alright finally finished the A-Z videos
11/17/2019 14:33:40,now time to start paper trading
11/17/2019 15:15:33,How does the FCF affect the intrinsic value of a company
11/17/2019 15:38:21,What’s the difference between NGZ19 and NGZ15 and all those different futures... I assume they have the same underlying commodity but why the different futures?
11/17/2019 15:39:23,What is natural gas report Ricky is talking in video ? Where can I find that ?
11/17/2019 15:57:32,https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/weekly/
11/17/2019 15:59:00,Thanks Goetz
11/17/2019 15:59:59,<@640575154677612545> its the different years. NGZ19 is Dec 2019, NGZ20 is Dec 2020; how exactly they are priced I am still trying to understand and figure out.
11/17/2019 16:01:43,<@643846250323771413> I figured it had something to do with that, but then I asked myself why <@337602917731270656> would be trading NGZ15
11/17/2019 16:02:19,check  out the supply and demand charts at the bottom of the article. pretty informative <@643846250323771413>
11/17/2019 16:05:33,<@640575154677612545> i think those are probably old videos. My trading platform (schwab) doesn't even show ngz15 anymore.
11/17/2019 16:06:28,Ok. Thanks you <@643846250323771413>
11/17/2019 16:08:06,The z19 /z20 are the December futures.
11/17/2019 16:08:47,Ngf20 is the January 20 future. I assume the December future is most relevant because of the peak in demand
11/17/2019 16:12:19,I see, thanks again
11/17/2019 16:14:48,https://www.velocityshares.com/etns/product/dgaz/
11/17/2019 16:15:10,Looking at the product details, Ngf20 is now the underlying future for DGAZ
11/17/2019 16:17:29,<@337602917731270656> i had a look at the prospectus of dgaz, using Jan20 future now. As of last week you still focused on NGZ19. Trying to understand this topic, so digging for information
11/17/2019 16:17:34,https://www.velocityshares.com/etns/product/dgaz/
11/17/2019 16:18:49,Thanks for posting  <@643846250323771413>. Helpful

11/16/2019 03:52:06,Education takes 5-6 years to finish, and 100,000 in debt. Then starting from zero and being bossed through out your life.                                           But, stock pays
You 1 million in 5-6 years. Whaaat!! Both need dedication and hard work. I wanna be a millionaire, Sir.
11/16/2019 04:00:05,everything you lost yesterday, is only opportunity cost for tomorrow. invest your newfound knowledge and experience into yourself today and watch everything you do double tomorrow.

11/15/2019 23:53:20,<@337602917731270656> Wouldn't it be a good idea to update the LPP "Brokerage List" with new commissions, or lack thereof
11/15/2019 23:53:37,Yes I’m on it
11/15/2019 23:53:41,Thank you
11/15/2019 23:53:59,yeah of course
11/15/2019 23:57:26,<@337602917731270656> when is updated LPP coming ?
11/16/2019 00:10:39,UGAZ all rock!
11/16/2019 00:33:24,Question :   if you have $30k in an account.   And you own $25k in Amazon.  Are you restricted to 3 day trades with that last 5k?
11/16/2019 00:40:52,Is td free trading like rh?
11/16/2019 00:42:52,<@238701693292904449> : as long as combined balance remains above $25k, pdt rule do now apply. Just in case amazon share goes down and your combined balance goes below 25k, pdt kicks in.
11/16/2019 00:43:42,Interesting.  Thanks <@407563572588314636>

11/15/2019 22:36:21,so the price of your options went up like 450% today?

11/15/2019 22:38:42,<@337602917731270656> I took your advice on not forcing a trade when the market opens. I’ve been green ever since.
11/15/2019 22:39:13,<@643846250323771413> only in $9k

11/15/2019 22:40:53,remember a few days ago we both believed I could fill my shorts at 139; I fortunately closed it out at 141. ROKU has been solid +5% every day. would have been a heck of a week just to hold it

11/15/2019 22:54:20,that bothers me cause i dont know when it will pull back
11/15/2019 21:51:10,<@525795786001219585> is a bad influence <@337602917731270656>
11/15/2019 21:51:10,lets keep it consistent!
11/15/2019 21:51:12,<@337602917731270656> needs a how i flipped my lambo for profit video

11/15/2019 21:52:06,Truly happy how you all work with one another
11/15/2019 21:52:27,team environment in my opinion is very important
11/15/2019 21:52:45,no one has ever made it to the top alone
11/15/2019 21:53:07,👌
11/15/2019 21:53:48,<@337602917731270656> I concur, thanks for setting this up!
11/15/2019 21:55:50,i really just be vibin out here with a 1.8k loss today
11/15/2019 21:55:57,<@570234921935962122> your options ended yet?
11/15/2019 21:56:17,its ok ice i'm on the red train too
11/15/2019 21:56:26,its a long way back up
11/15/2019 21:56:49,yessir👌 slow and steady you gotta dig yourself out
11/15/2019 21:56:54,yup
11/15/2019 21:57:05,I’ve been closed it man.
11/15/2019 21:57:33,i have yet to figure out why i can profit every time in simulated trading but not real trading
11/15/2019 21:57:37,<@570234921935962122> how much you made ?
11/15/2019 21:57:46,like 350k
11/15/2019 21:57:59,i think tos ondemand hooks you up when getting filled
11/15/2019 21:59:03,<@598034981213831188> I tend to make less emotional decisions on paper. Is that probably the reason? I cover losses too early and don't let the trade play out with cash
11/15/2019 22:00:54,<@643846250323771413> thats sometimes it. usually when i'm ondemand trading it always results in an instant profit with in minutes and i just lock in. but real trading i somehow end up taking a quick loss right away
11/15/2019 22:01:40,thats why i think ondmenad fills you at the best price, when entering and exiting, its like it maximizes the profit for you.
11/15/2019 22:03:20,mmh. thats not good. For me its the hesitation, missing the entry or then cutting my losses too early or too late; or exactly at the wrong point. Risk management, Ricky mentioned that once or twice... 🤦‍♂️
11/15/2019 22:05:50,yeah im not sure what it is. because i'm trading exactly the same on both. i'll time my entries well and very conservatively, a little past confirmation. and i think by then, in real trading, i get filled with a crappy price and it leaves no margin so it sells off. but ondemand likes to instantly fill you at what you want so i get it at a good deal, leaving better margin
11/15/2019 22:17:13,<@188061790192664585> im down little 500 lol
11/15/2019 22:18:09,Boy did I miss out today! Overall Ended the day down $105 with a $60 gain on UWT. But going back on my UGAZ trade yes I did miss out a lot on how it played out but this was before the quick change of direction! Still pleased with my overall performance this week in consistently hitting my goal and keeping losses small! Next week is a new set of opportunities let's learn from this week and prepare for the next! Wish you all an amazing & blessed weekend! @everyone
11/15/2019 22:18:33,lol
11/15/2019 22:18:37,same trade man

11/15/2019 22:22:13,ROKU dropping is a good sight
11/15/2019 22:23:11,$$$$
11/15/2019 22:23:24,<@337602917731270656> I shared a screenshot earlier. The volume was low and we had so many pushes with sudden spikes of volume  in NG At least for me, that was not to predict. does that happen often? I was pretty confident with my DGAZ position but then those pushes kept repeating. once recovery started I was so scared of another volume spike, I sold off
11/15/2019 22:24:08,What should I do this weekend?
11/15/2019 22:24:32,<@570234921935962122> real estate if u wana be a millionaire by the time you’re 21 lol

11/15/2019 21:43:45,to bad most of the stocks he shorts
11/15/2019 21:43:47,requires

11/15/2019 21:43:52,oof
11/15/2019 21:43:58,for brokers to let you do what he does
11/15/2019 21:44:02,yeah
11/15/2019 21:44:08,Yes definitely takes capital
11/15/2019 21:44:10,most would be min. $100k

11/15/2019 21:47:41,It’s really frustrating, on IB... on trade zero I could get fills but then my account dipped below $3k and you can’t even use the web trader so I pulled the rest out and told them to f off

11/15/2019 20:50:21,DGAZ 109

11/15/2019 20:51:24,<@643846250323771413> yeah prety comfortable with this position
11/15/2019 20:51:31,went from 75 shares to 50 now
11/15/2019 20:51:39,i know anything can happen but it seems less volatile
11/15/2019 20:53:29,i am currently 75 short of roku. but profitable. so all good
11/15/2019 20:54:34,Acb dyeing
11/15/2019 20:54:46,Holding weekend
11/15/2019 20:55:10,If every licensed marijuana company in Canada stop growing trees today theyd still have enough stockpile to sell for the next 3-1/2 years
11/15/2019 20:56:03,Not good for any of their stocks
11/15/2019 20:57:13,ugaz swing
11/15/2019 20:57:25,<@525795786001219585> and Roku is up again. Damn
11/15/2019 20:57:37,I swear to fucking god every goddam time I decided to cut losses the fuck thing shoots to the moon
11/15/2019 20:57:45,Allllll day been look for a exit
11/15/2019 20:57:57,its like if nat gas had 240btu. could last for a couple years and the stocks wouldnt be worth shit
11/15/2019 20:58:13,Instantly when I sold it shot to the price I’ve been waiting for all day
11/15/2019 20:06:55,gonna wait until monday
11/15/2019 20:06:57,let it build a support at this level
11/15/2019 20:07:15,yeah
11/15/2019 20:07:17,fact is, people will start taking profits soon and youre gonna see heavy selling, just like what happened at 176
11/15/2019 20:07:20,Anyone swinging UGAZ this weekend
11/15/2019 20:07:21,only reason ROKU went nonstop up today is because
11/15/2019 20:07:27,this week* is because of DIS
11/15/2019 20:07:50,<@611576737473495103> not really
11/15/2019 20:07:56,only $10k position tho
11/15/2019 20:08:23,i should be able to sell for a profit pre-market
11/15/2019 20:08:23,monday
11/15/2019 20:09:28,<@265359928212979712> that's also why i might consider a put
11/15/2019 20:10:01,thoughts on DIS everyone?
11/15/2019 20:10:28,I bought some DIS and bought Call options
11/15/2019 20:10:43,<@611576737473495103> rough $ entry?
11/15/2019 20:10:57,we know that the last 2 times it was near this level it was followed by heavy selling, so lets see what happens going into next week, if roku doesnt start selling off today its because the markets greedy and wants to squeeze more profit out of it. Which would make me think that next week, the selloff will begin
11/15/2019 20:11:05,will roku break another hod today?
11/15/2019 20:11:21,if ROKU at 150 tomororw imma be balling
11/15/2019 20:11:28,<@265359928212979712> that was my assumption
11/15/2019 20:11:45,<@525795786001219585> tomorrow?
11/15/2019 20:11:46,you mean monday
11/15/2019 20:11:46,"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."
11/15/2019 20:11:53,<@525795786001219585> my entry was around $144.50
11/15/2019 20:12:00,cant believe i had the most perfect entry on DGAZ
11/15/2019 20:12:09,but didnt set a limit order when i drove home
11/15/2019 20:12:48,<@525795786001219585> trading and driving an elite sport
11/15/2019 20:12:50,<@611576737473495103> solid entry
11/15/2019 20:13:02,also bouta make $100 on quick roku scalp

11/15/2019 20:13:54,not sure if i want to sell all my positions for a $250 loss
11/15/2019 20:14:05,and go heavy scalping
11/15/2019 20:14:06,to green

11/15/2019 20:17:22,Ng looks like a head and shoulders pattern only upside down
11/15/2019 20:17:48,An inverted H & S is bullish
11/15/2019 20:17:57,Made a quick 10% on AIHS
11/15/2019 20:18:14,ate so much food after the gym i feel like im gonna throw up
11/15/2019 20:18:18,<@525795786001219585> if Roku hits 170 again are you buying a second house?
11/15/2019 20:18:20,Yeah it’s showing it on the 6 month 4 hour chart
11/15/2019 20:18:50,<@611576737473495103> DIS hurting me
11/15/2019 20:19:17,<@458831021069041664>  lol im shorting ROKU by accident
11/15/2019 20:19:17,i would prefer a long position
11/15/2019 20:21:58,Hey guys, dumb question but I'm kind of confused on what is considered a "Cash account" on Robinhood
11/15/2019 20:21:58,I remember when Roku was at 70 bucks and I was contemplating a long position...
11/15/2019 20:22:10,Son of a gun you never know
11/15/2019 20:22:20,If I fund it directly from my bank, is it considered a cash acc?
11/15/2019 20:22:51,YOLO - https://m.benzinga.com/article/14823041
11/15/2019 20:28:18,Dwt is not moving
11/15/2019 20:02:42,ROKU decides to full on 180 next week
11/15/2019 20:02:44,lets go dgaz
11/15/2019 20:02:51,ROKU has been THE MOST consistent stokc ive ever seen in my life lol
11/15/2019 20:02:58,Alright guys..  im heading out to the range to shoot some of my guns.  Before going to the casino..  good luck everyone
11/15/2019 20:03:06,<@!406482262675423233> yup
11/15/2019 20:03:13,too bad im accidentally shorting ROKU
11/15/2019 20:03:17,put the hood down when you got the gun out
11/15/2019 20:03:19,not a good look
11/15/2019 20:03:40,the question is
11/15/2019 20:03:45,is it too late to get into ROKU or will it just keep going up
11/15/2019 20:03:56,ROKU just seems to be profiting off of NFLX and DIS's constant battles against each other trying to one up each other
11/15/2019 20:04:02,and their own stuff... but it's been nonstop trending
11/15/2019 20:04:03,holy fuck
11/15/2019 20:04:08,It literally can reverse at any moment
11/15/2019 20:04:11,but it won't...
11/15/2019 20:04:13,i never even looked at roku
11/15/2019 20:04:16,wow
11/15/2019 20:04:16,Lol..  this is northern California.  We dont have snowflakes around here    <@580151066855866379>
11/15/2019 20:04:17,down $6 on ugaz... not sure if i sell or keep swinging
11/15/2019 20:04:17,yeah
11/15/2019 20:04:20,ROKU is up 30%
11/15/2019 20:04:21,in one week
11/15/2019 20:04:26,<@482402495101140993> good
11/15/2019 20:04:36,<@!406482262675423233> ROKU broke all resistances
11/15/2019 20:04:42,yeah
11/15/2019 20:04:43,heading back to 170 in no time
11/15/2019 20:04:44,imo
11/15/2019 20:04:51,i might set a couple calls
11/15/2019 20:04:55,maybe one
11/15/2019 20:04:57,not sure
11/15/2019 20:05:07,ROKU trades hugely on momentum, so if youre apprehensive just wait for a pullback because it'll happen
11/15/2019 20:05:25,well ROKU just broke the last conceivable resistance
11/15/2019 20:05:29,next one is at 176
11/15/2019 20:05:35,or 170 rather
11/15/2019 20:05:38,roku a good swing?
11/15/2019 20:05:41,needs a pull back tho
11/15/2019 20:05:42,but RSI and MACD on 180 chart
11/15/2019 20:05:44,is unhealthily overextended
11/15/2019 20:05:47,need to get out of this positon
11/15/2019 20:05:50,fuck sakes
11/15/2019 20:06:01,<@525795786001219585> you may be good
11/15/2019 20:06:08,sold 25 shares of roku but my broker sold 100 shares
11/15/2019 20:06:13,now im shorting 75 shares

11/15/2019 17:53:13,Prob one more run for ugaz then dipped back then maybe
11/15/2019 17:53:24,<@188217042141315072> what would be hinting you to buy either?
11/15/2019 17:53:25,<@639711638429368321> those huge peaks in volume drove the price up. take your time. really worried that there us another big buy coming on NG
11/15/2019 17:53:25,With 2000 contract you only need .50 move to get 100k 🤷🏻‍♂️ easy hahahaha
11/15/2019 17:54:27,Hahahahayaya

11/15/2019 17:54:40,<@378396342214459412> to get 2000 contracts you need so much money
11/15/2019 17:54:42,I’m all in on DWT

11/15/2019 17:33:47,Been waiting for UGAZ to recover from MONDAY
11/15/2019 17:33:51,everything I did went wrong this week
11/15/2019 17:34:00,not a single course of action I took was the right one of the 50/50
11/15/2019 17:34:10,from NG, to options

11/15/2019 17:34:25,caught it at 18.79 when I looked at it was at freakin 16 big boy bagholding
11/15/2019 17:35:02,NVDA was the only one that looked like a win until it decided to open up -90% for no reason at all
11/15/2019 17:35:15,WHat does DGAZ normally do after UGAZ starts to pullback? does it start to go up a lot and do you all buy it or was UGAZ the main play of the day?
11/15/2019 17:35:31,Want CL to drop already
11/15/2019 17:35:38,Me too
11/15/2019 17:36:34,Ng goes up and so does CL

11/15/2019 17:37:37,You guys see UGAZ
11/15/2019 17:37:45,Why Is it like this
11/15/2019 17:37:54,NG does what it wants
11/15/2019 17:37:56,cold ass weather
11/15/2019 17:38:05,BEUH

11/15/2019 17:38:11,Look at UGAZ
11/15/2019 17:38:11,I just went to wash my hands, what the hell happened to NG. Everytime the price consolidates seems like volume peaks and price shoots up
11/15/2019 17:38:16,And yoinked away
11/15/2019 17:38:16,I cant complain up $1600
11/15/2019 17:38:22,Lucky
11/15/2019 17:38:35,Does anyone know what makes UGAZ go this high
11/15/2019 17:38:48,UGAZ crazy
11/15/2019 17:38:55,But how
11/15/2019 17:39:00,https://www.natgasweather.com/  Going into the overnight data, the GFS was much colder than the European model on the Nov 21-28th pattern.  However, now both are much closer together after the GFS lost 10 HDD’s compared to its run 24-hours ago, while the European model gained 10 HDD’s. It’s difficult to know if the nat gas markets will be disappointed the GFS backed off or if they will be satisfied the gained European demand. Or maybe they offset?  The early morning 6z GFS data added some demand back, which could have aided the morning spike.  Today’s trade could again bring wild swings as the nat gas markets digest mixed overnight weather trends, while positioning for another risky weekend to hold where a gap open should be expected in the direction of temperature trends.
11/15/2019 17:39:06,Weather maybe
11/15/2019 17:39:06,<@643846250323771413> u still holding dgaz ?

11/15/2019 17:03:30,a CFD is like a ETF in a way (underlying asset on a commodity) so you can choose your leverage by applying the difference between contracts

11/15/2019 16:48:39,<@557313549391888395> I have the same problem, if you're a citizen from the EU you're not allowed to trade with ETF from USA...
11/15/2019 16:49:00,Some EU regulation...

11/15/2019 16:50:24,<@557313549391888395> check out IG.com. You can trade with CFD
11/15/2019 16:50:27,TradeZero is offshore so theres no PDT rule and you can trade ETFs and all other US stocks + the fees are really cheap
11/15/2019 16:50:28,Gonna break again

11/15/2019 16:57:00,<@557313549391888395> No worries, I use ig.com and like it. But you trade with the commodity itself, so not the ETF's. You can also choose the leverage yourself 3x, 5x, 10x 🙂
11/15/2019 16:57:20,Watch out for ng bounce

11/15/2019 16:35:46,What do you guys think about DWT at this level?
11/15/2019 16:35:50,15.86 resistance?
11/15/2019 16:35:56,Cl overbought
11/15/2019 16:36:05,NVDA BACK TO 206
11/15/2019 16:36:06,wait for dwt confirmation, still looks sketchy asf
11/15/2019 16:36:07,are you fucking me
11/15/2019 16:36:17,57.8 resistance?
11/15/2019 16:36:21,I’m not sure about DWT any more. Until it starts to show a reversal. It is a good deal though
11/15/2019 16:36:22,pullback soon?
11/15/2019 16:36:22,CL may not be overbought on a weekly basis, may shoot up big within the coming weeks
11/15/2019 16:36:33,I see a pullback
11/15/2019 16:37:02,we all want a pullback
11/15/2019 16:37:25,notice how /cl was consolidating near a resistance, if it breaks it, it can be a nice run
11/15/2019 16:37:35,No pullback
11/15/2019 16:37:42,yes pullback

11/15/2019 15:57:21,he'll make 11k today from other income anyway
11/15/2019 15:57:25,more likely he was sad the market wasn't more exciting on a friday since fridays are expected to be one of the better days of the week
11/15/2019 15:57:28,<@560833923957915649>  ya -_- its suck
11/15/2019 15:57:46,is it not possible to set a buy limit order above the market price? my orders always automatically fill...

11/15/2019 15:58:18,dgaz baby
11/15/2019 15:58:26,i didn't see him mad, but if ricky was mad it has nothing to do with a small loss. it is more of a passion thing. he has so much passion for the market and lets all agree none of us like to be wrong specially in the markets, even a 50 buck loss that is red i feel some type of way haa
11/15/2019 15:58:36,<@!406482262675423233> hows your day going?

11/15/2019 10:02:04,Maybe get some coco
11/15/2019 10:02:10,🤪
11/15/2019 10:02:32,"How did you got so successful?" "-Weeelll.."😂
11/15/2019 10:03:32,Ugaz does not look promising at all.. all articles say that it will get cheaper... what do you guys think?
11/15/2019 10:04:28,That’s right, honestly this week I’ve been buying pre market (which is night time here) then put a stop loss, go to bed, let it run while I’m asleep, wake up and sell after market
11/15/2019 10:04:45,So I wasn’t anxious seeing how the stock moves
11/15/2019 10:04:54,Worked out pretty well
11/15/2019 10:05:50,for ETFs? Pretty volatile..  Your stop should've been 3-5%?
11/15/2019 10:06:10,I bought ROKU at 134.47 and sold wayyy too soon due to me not being able to look at charts since i had class and work
11/15/2019 10:06:36,I sold it at 138 because that was the last look I had before I was going to be unable to look at charts
11/15/2019 10:07:05,<@594170409935437825> oh no just stocks, I did roku and Lk
11/15/2019 10:07:46,For ETF I feel like I need to be watching my screen all the time, can’t trust them
11/15/2019 10:08:06,<@486023262627823619> use stop losses dude
11/15/2019 10:08:20,Let it ride
11/15/2019 10:08:37,yeah
11/15/2019 10:09:11,For some reason my stop losses wont trigger (lost a couple hundred dollars because of it)
11/15/2019 10:12:54,Weird, never happened to me
11/15/2019 10:13:20,Are you sure you are using the right stop loss order? There are different kind of orders
11/15/2019 10:13:26,At least with my broker
11/15/2019 10:13:53,i used robinhood at the time which i still do since im not too comfortable with TOS buying and selling
11/15/2019 10:14:00,I always set the same price for the stop limit and auxiliar price
11/15/2019 10:14:41,Good ol NG doing what it knows best
11/15/2019 10:18:37,<@506988023381098526> what's it know best

11/15/2019 09:08:39,goodmorning
11/15/2019 09:34:22,Hello everybody. 
Hope your all doing well!
I am a complete beginner and I have a problem with setting up my VWAP indicator. It only shows 1 line, instead of 3..
Do you have any suggestions on what i might have done wrong?
Thanks!
11/15/2019 09:45:51,<@630066120065286144> go to studies, edit studies, click on the gear icon and it should bring up setting, click on upper/lower band and ensure that show plot is ticked
11/15/2019 09:51:23,Potential bounce for UGAZ since it will be bouncing off 20 SMA on the daily chart (last time it jumped 4%)
11/15/2019 09:58:13,I mistakenly sold my roku shares😭😭 instead of stop limit I sold as limit sale but still made 7%
11/15/2019 09:58:18,So kind of bittersweet
11/15/2019 09:58:37,<@483747779911483392> fucking decent trade bro

11/15/2019 00:40:40,10000$ x 1% its took 463 trade to make 1 M
11/15/2019 00:41:22,Shitty thing was I was at in ugaz at 15.30 on that spike but the stoplight turned green and I sold at 15.40
11/15/2019 00:41:26,Let the wining trade run just secured your 1%
11/15/2019 00:41:50,<@473695043665002508> ya exactly what i doo

11/15/2019 00:42:35,Going to see how it works for me next week
11/15/2019 00:42:49,How % this week ?

11/15/2019 00:44:46,Crap crap
11/15/2019 00:45:08,Loss 2% on jnug
11/15/2019 00:45:24,But I have been recovering on penny stocks
11/15/2019 00:45:29,😐
11/15/2019 00:45:32,Never trde penny stock
11/15/2019 00:45:34,To volatile
11/15/2019 00:45:47,Lost alot one time on a penny haha
11/15/2019 00:45:56,I been watching some videos from Ross
11/15/2019 00:46:18,Ya he is good at it but in and out faster then i enter my buying psoition haa
11/15/2019 00:47:44,I took 3 penny stock trades 1. Up 22% 2. Up 78% 3. I don’t remember but I made $300
11/15/2019 00:48:09,Small trades
11/15/2019 00:49:06,<@473695043665002508> I like that 1% a day.. very doable tbh
11/15/2019 00:50:55,Ugaz to $12 tomorrow and acb $2 next month
11/15/2019 00:51:12,I have taken many trades where I’m up 1 or 2% but don’t lock in my profits and end up giving everything back <@613126251174952983> b
11/15/2019 00:51:29,I sure this happens to all of us
11/15/2019 00:55:04,is ricky trading with less that 100k now? he announces his 1%+ or higher but p/l at like 500-600?
11/15/2019 00:58:36,<@473695043665002508> maaan, I have days where im 7% and give it all back the same day & all because I’m being greedy
11/15/2019 00:58:51,I get myself pissed most of the times .. lol
11/15/2019 00:59:51,like today I was up $400 & only locked profit at $100 and I just think of how dumb I was not to lock profits
11/15/2019 01:00:16,I’m always breaking even
11/15/2019 01:05:34,what are we swinging over night??
11/15/2019 01:05:42,DGAZ
11/15/2019 01:05:44,UGAZ or DGAZ??????
11/15/2019 01:06:26,DGAZ = 1
11/15/2019 01:06:30,UGAZ = 0
11/15/2019 01:06:35,Nothing
11/15/2019 00:22:44,i should tone down my standards to your level
11/15/2019 00:22:47,and just be happy with 1-2% wins
11/15/2019 00:22:51,because even if i average 6% a week or so
11/15/2019 00:22:56,that's still 24% a month which is insane
11/15/2019 00:23:35,<@350163012440686592> that’s what I’m thinking
11/15/2019 00:24:07,but only good for day trading, you never know when the weather hits and turns dGAZ upside down
11/15/2019 00:24:09,U sold acb?? <@501949803236818975>
11/15/2019 00:24:23,True
11/15/2019 00:24:49,<@!406482262675423233> yes that's why I'm thinking about closing my long term positions and putting it into day trading. 30%/yr is good but... DT potential seems to be there. not sure htough w/only 4mo DT under my belt.
11/15/2019 00:24:50,<@473695043665002508> not looking good for ng but it has been hitting record high production
11/15/2019 00:24:52,going to close my DGAZ position before the post-market closes
11/15/2019 00:25:34,👍
11/15/2019 00:26:14,i need to keep thinking of the big picture
11/15/2019 00:26:18,theres nothing wrong with making only 5% a week
11/15/2019 00:26:21,cuz that's still 20% a month
11/15/2019 00:26:26,i gotta stop greeding for these big 3-5% days
11/15/2019 00:26:55,if it was just technicals then 100% swing
11/15/2019 00:27:11,but with these Etfs, fundamentals fuck you hard if its not in ur direction
11/15/2019 00:27:42,<@473695043665002508> yes
11/15/2019 00:27:55,<@406482262675423233> i want 1.5%/ week
11/15/2019 00:27:57,I've been ending my trading days at 1-2% but it's hard not to fomo
11/15/2019 00:28:26,<@!406482262675423233> 100% on that long term thing though
11/15/2019 00:28:48,ikr?
11/15/2019 00:28:50,i really like
11/15/2019 00:28:52,the fomo is real...
11/15/2019 00:29:22,That’s really good <@594778076248801313>  once you get to 1m does 1% 2% day will turn into 10k 20k days
11/15/2019 00:29:25,especially when i keep seeing <@473695043665002508> and his 10% gainz lol
11/15/2019 00:29:33,😂
11/15/2019 00:30:45,<@473695043665002508> you're my main FOMO contributor
11/15/2019 00:30:54,😂
11/15/2019 00:30:57,🤣
11/15/2019 00:31:44,time to go release some of this pent up aggression and go get punched in the face and choked out for a while.

11/15/2019 00:36:43,That’s the goal  if you trade with 25k and average 1% a day 5% a week for 50 weeks a year in 3 years you will have ur million
11/15/2019 00:36:54,<@473695043665002508> ya
11/15/2019 00:37:09,If you reenter 100%

11/15/2019 00:11:01,it either goes down or it goes up
11/15/2019 00:11:06,but why does it feel more like 10/90

11/15/2019 00:05:43,I've only been day trading for 4 months now small positions to get my feet wet. My long term portfolio averages about 30% for the past 4 years, thinking about closing out all my LT positions though for more day trading power. Day trading definitely a different beast.

11/14/2019 22:54:18,ACB might have a dead cat bounce tomorrow morning. it might pop at the bell and than continue to go down.
11/14/2019 22:54:32,UGAZ is being manipulated. It is nowhere near 1% of NAV right now.
11/14/2019 22:54:45,<@515871297964605450>

11/14/2019 22:55:58,there is not one winner in the weed stocks

11/14/2019 22:56:39,Some dude on here tried to catch the knife 🔪
11/14/2019 22:57:02,Despite most of us telling him it was a bad idea
11/14/2019 22:57:05,acb that is a brutal fall
11/14/2019 22:57:14,Yup
11/14/2019 22:57:43,that industry is dead for a few years
11/14/2019 22:58:32,Until weed is fully legalized
11/14/2019 23:00:05,weed stocks permanently fight an uphill battle
11/14/2019 23:00:29,timr to talk about it, is he a salesman?
11/14/2019 23:01:40,<@613126251174952983> what year and trim is your challenger??
11/14/2019 23:03:30,<@451050417703616541> it’s a 2018 Challenger RT Plus
11/14/2019 23:06:07,I've got a 19 gt plus <@613126251174952983> I never thought about decorating it🤣 that legit
11/14/2019 23:13:14,ACB fake out wick?
11/14/2019 23:13:55,🧐 I think imma apply for margin account again
11/14/2019 23:14:04,Cash account sucks 🥺
11/14/2019 23:27:40,Need ng to pick a direction tomorrow
11/14/2019 23:31:21,<@635161962720002048>  if you never had one be careful what you wish for...
11/14/2019 23:33:35,I only say this because when I started trading, my margin account got me in trouble...lol
11/14/2019 23:35:14,<@635161962720002048> way better than cash. Just don’t go crazy with it. I basically only have margin so I can trade the next day after taking a trade if I want to with my full account size. I rarely use margin to trade twice in one day under PDT
11/14/2019 23:35:25,But way better than having to wait 3 days for all that cash to settle
11/14/2019 23:36:33,<@635161962720002048> start win with cash before margin
11/14/2019 23:37:29,<@462090277725929472> dont understand
11/14/2019 23:37:41,When i enter my cash acount and sell 5 min after i can buy ...
11/14/2019 23:40:05,Yeah it’s because you’re maybe using 50% of your portfolio. If you have 10k and use 7k on a trade, you can still trade with 3k that same day
11/14/2019 23:40:54,No like 98% and after 98% haha
11/14/2019 23:42:15,Oh shit that’s weird. You sure u don’t have margin lol
11/14/2019 23:43:41,Naw I have a cash account and I can’t use my money until after a day or two
11/14/2019 23:44:23,Maybe its because im in canada 🤷🏻‍♂️
11/14/2019 23:44:41,And I believe if in margin I have 10k I can buy for 6k and sell and then rebuy something else for 6k👀
11/14/2019 23:44:42,Well yeh Canada doesn’t have pdt rule
11/14/2019 23:44:48,Whaaaaaaat

11/14/2019 18:43:30,<@422649307464859648> I'm shorting it till it hits 33-32
11/14/2019 18:43:51,What’s your avg?
11/14/2019 18:45:36,<@422649307464859648> 47.74 on the TSX version of it 🙂 but that's the equivalent of the 35.98 top on the NYSE GOOS
11/14/2019 18:46:18,up about 2.35% rn
11/14/2019 18:46:43,Awesome. What would be a good entry short for rn to ride it until 31?
11/14/2019 18:51:22,I personally wouldn't enter it now because it already fell by 2.35% and I like my R:R tighter than virgin maria's P****Y... I don't wanna be the cause of your failed trade x) but if you wait for it hike up until the 35.45-35.6 Demand Level there's a good chance it bounces back down again
11/14/2019 18:51:36,<@525795786001219585> sorry was cutting some rope
11/14/2019 18:51:38,just wait for it to reach a confirmed supply/demand level

11/14/2019 18:25:18,ROKU is probably my least favorite streaming device i have...and yet...$$$$
11/14/2019 18:27:51,1:10 risk:reward short on GOOS 
Goos headed towards hitting its 6 month low after ER drop, currently SHORTING the reversal of the reversal. 10% potential, currently at 2.5% P/L on this short. The big panty dropper will be when it hits its 6 month low, potentially bouncing up with a 38% potential uptrend. Happy trading :)

11/14/2019 16:10:53,(yesterday)
11/14/2019 16:10:56,buying otm options comes with a higher degree of risk but if youre right the payoff is nice
11/14/2019 15:56:41,then when it hits 12 you will want it to hit 10 then 8 and 0 lol <@501949803236818975>
11/14/2019 15:56:45,ng looks to be struggling
11/14/2019 15:56:53,they should've been all over ugaz when that report came up just look at the storage increase trend
11/14/2019 15:56:53,<@520627258419970068> what did the report say to you?
11/14/2019 15:56:55,in dgaz too

11/14/2019 15:57:47,Dgaz
11/14/2019 15:57:50,it's probably asked but what time is the crude oil report today?
11/14/2019 15:57:51,it said there was more draw this last week than previous weeks, although still more storage than this time last year and slightly above 5yr avg. compared to where it's been there's less inventory because of the deman
11/14/2019 15:57:51,<@337602917731270656>  not staying live for the crude report?
11/14/2019 15:57:54,demand

11/14/2019 16:00:07,daaaaaamn CL
11/14/2019 16:00:14,if i had to guess, ugaz will shoot up by end of day just like yesterday when people read report they're just waiting to see how low it goes. I don't think it get to $12 again, at that point it should just reverse split if it does
11/14/2019 16:00:42,what is going on lol
11/14/2019 16:00:49,CL wyd? lol
11/14/2019 16:00:57,i think the smart play is to play them both (dgaz and ugaz
11/14/2019 16:00:59,okay its clear now haha
11/14/2019 16:01:01,CL sell off!

11/14/2019 16:04:06,I thought /cl report won't come out in half hour
11/14/2019 16:04:15,nope at 11, not sure where you guus got at 1130
11/14/2019 16:04:19,wow that was a quick reversal on ugaz
11/14/2019 16:04:20,i like that push
11/14/2019 16:04:23,did not expect that
11/14/2019 16:04:31,i dont trust it

11/14/2019 16:04:43,17
11/14/2019 16:04:43,going to have to hold off for now
11/14/2019 15:48:36,<@503967311523479563> hardly
11/14/2019 15:48:49,you should be cheering.. arent you in UGAZ heavily?
11/14/2019 15:49:06,Ricky want to buy ugaz
11/14/2019 15:49:09,<@503967311523479563> I'm in UGAZ heavy and down heavy
11/14/2019 15:49:20,<@623678795102158880>  what average price ?
11/14/2019 15:49:42,maybe people didnt read the report properly and traded the wrong way???
11/14/2019 15:49:46,y'all should have seen this coming. all that pump yesterday was BS. they dumped all this shit
11/14/2019 15:50:18,it def looks appealing right now
11/14/2019 15:50:26,prob just manipulated from big money expecting little money to pre-buy ugaz and panic sell
11/14/2019 15:50:34,every time there is that type of pump before the report day it mostly does this
11/14/2019 15:51:05,i'm covinced people don't even read the report, they hear someone say ugaz and they buy, dgaz and they buy
11/14/2019 15:51:24,9 min till CL report
11/14/2019 15:51:30,or they sell if someone says the opposite of what they're in
11/14/2019 15:51:32,<@463163453213769729>  its not 11h30 ?
11/14/2019 15:51:32,just wait for computers to trade them up or down
11/14/2019 15:51:43,I want to cry.  I thought I sold my entire ugaz position right before the report.  Apparently I bought double the amount of shares and averaged up.  What a way to go to work 😦
11/14/2019 15:51:47,<@258651262919114752> not neccessarily, I think people were expecting a decrease in supply, especially given this was most likely the coldest week of 2019, at least in the northeast. So given there was an increase, even though it was small, people are not ready to play yet
11/14/2019 15:52:21,I say that because when I started I was the same way, it was frustrating to never be correct, then I actually started reading the storage report, and looking at weather forecasts
11/14/2019 15:52:47,<@463163453213769729>  thx why it was not yesterday ?
11/14/2019 15:52:57,Holiday

11/14/2019 15:43:22,well that was a fail
11/14/2019 15:43:26,Who else thinks there is no UGAZ season this year? 🤔 Beginning to think it already spiked for the year

11/14/2019 15:44:20,switching your team hats
11/14/2019 15:44:35,im still bullish on ugaz
11/14/2019 15:44:46,<@503967311523479563> with all the back and forth the decay is insane. Even at 3.1 it likely wont reach September highs
11/14/2019 15:44:48,just didnt want to tie up all my funds
11/14/2019 15:44:58,im talking about daily <@590353961056337974>
11/14/2019 15:45:00,Ugaz going back up
11/14/2019 15:45:03,If you’ve been watching these reports you know whatever one sells off usually pushes up later in the day
11/14/2019 15:45:11,ugaz getting rejected lol
11/14/2019 15:45:13,Even Ricky has mentioned it before
11/14/2019 15:45:29,keword "usually" not always
11/14/2019 15:45:32,usuallu
11/14/2019 15:45:35,^
11/14/2019 15:45:40,Does ricky know everything?
11/14/2019 15:45:49,I’m not saying it has too I’m just saying it’s not even selling off that hard
11/14/2019 15:45:55,agreed
11/14/2019 15:46:05,yeah it couldve been worse
11/14/2019 15:46:14,just look at bigger time frame you will see it at support right now..
11/14/2019 15:46:18,but does anyone ACTUALLY know what the report said or are they spitting random numbers out of their mouth?
11/14/2019 15:46:34,cuz ive heard like 3 different things in this chat
11/14/2019 15:46:40,<@503967311523479563>  witdraw of 42BFC
11/14/2019 15:46:43,look at the 4h lol youll see it getting rejected by ema
11/14/2019 15:46:49,each time frame tells a story
11/14/2019 15:46:57,as in favor of NG ? <@378396342214459412>
11/14/2019 15:47:04,next report will be a -BFC and yes favor ugaz <@503967311523479563>
11/14/2019 15:47:04,<@514206381784563712>damn, I thought I had it bad
11/14/2019 15:47:29,I'm chillin
11/14/2019 15:47:37,it'll buff
11/14/2019 15:47:55,UGAZ will probably have another spike but it wont be until january. Warmer than normal Decmeber is expected and even with supply injection ending demand wont drop inventory enough to see significant price changes.

11/14/2019 15:32:56,still injected 3
11/14/2019 15:32:58,Wrong SC. Forcasted was 45, actual was 3
11/14/2019 15:33:09,even after cold weather last week
11/14/2019 15:33:11,<@580151066855866379> did you sell? And at what price if you did

11/14/2019 15:33:26,Ugaz will recover most of the sells I would believe are algorithmic but ng is in season with no catalyst against it at the moment
11/14/2019 15:33:29,I had set limit price 15.40 and it came to 15.41 shit

11/14/2019 15:35:06,okay i came to the conclusion that less storages for natural gas = DGAZ up. switching to dgaz

11/14/2019 14:21:20,Oh yeah /cl going down today baby
11/14/2019 14:21:28,you get that 25k from your parents to go in on that?
11/14/2019 14:21:30,<@406482262675423233> report is at normal time
11/14/2019 14:21:32,<@!406482262675423233>  still feel the same about holdoing over night?
11/14/2019 14:21:33,<@!406482262675423233> i think report is on time today
11/14/2019 14:21:35,NG not matching UGAZ at all
11/14/2019 14:21:37,ohh ok
11/14/2019 14:21:42,Report is on time
11/14/2019 14:21:42,Why tf is SNNA so popular?
11/14/2019 14:21:45,So to get this straight nat gas report is at 10:30 as normal and the crude report is 11 correct?
11/14/2019 14:21:51,yep
11/14/2019 14:22:00,UGAZ is being manipulated. It is nowhere near 1% of NAV right now. I expect UGAZ to spike before inventory, then inventory will be crazy too
11/14/2019 14:22:16,<@347753927514521610> ngz19
11/14/2019 14:22:38,yes 19
11/14/2019 14:22:47,probably gonna sell DGAZ if NG goes back down to 2.65
11/14/2019 14:23:02,Ng to 3.1
11/14/2019 14:23:14,if it goes to 3.1 after decay how much is that for UGAZ? 18?
11/14/2019 14:23:16,19?
11/14/2019 14:23:21,24
11/14/2019 14:23:26,really?
11/14/2019 14:23:28,but decay o-o
11/14/2019 14:23:28,Ya
11/14/2019 14:23:37,Was predicting 25 but recalculated 24
11/14/2019 14:23:37,hm...
11/14/2019 14:23:40,maybe i should've
11/14/2019 14:23:43,hmmm
11/14/2019 14:23:46,yeah but i dont think it's gonna happen
11/14/2019 14:23:51,i feel like you think decay is happening at like 1$ a week lol
11/14/2019 14:23:51,if NG were to climb bak to 20
11/14/2019 14:23:51,Not sell ugaz ?? Ya haha
11/14/2019 14:23:53,it wouldn't make any sense
11/14/2019 14:24:07,what doesnt make sense?
11/14/2019 14:24:17,because UGAZ started going down after the huge climb last year early november same time as now
11/14/2019 14:24:19,Storage will be negative forecast soon
11/14/2019 14:24:22,Ugaz to the moon
11/14/2019 14:24:22,it would be weird to see NG continue
11/14/2019 14:24:43,ugaz/dgaz are in jan contracts
11/14/2019 14:24:44,patterns can repeat themselves, they dont have to
11/14/2019 14:24:50,sure sure but where is <@482402495101140993>

11/14/2019 13:45:28,<@469332626893832192> not a bad thought.. just remember to look at the 180 day chart and remember there’s still room for pullback on ugaz back to 12s.. keep those stop losses set and don’t get stuck bagholding
11/14/2019 13:46:11,<@497078307695755264> back to the yearly low durning the winter?

11/14/2019 12:58:36,so a lot of ya plan on going long UGAZ after the report today? Wasn't at my computer when that massive volume candle went through at 1:28 pm yesterday
11/14/2019 12:58:44,was planning on entering around that level
11/14/2019 12:58:46,<@580151066855866379> not really
11/14/2019 12:58:47,but it shot up
11/14/2019 12:58:49,position size small
11/14/2019 13:07:54,Ugaz round 2 let’s go
11/14/2019 13:08:32,08:04 ET  - Natural gas prices rise more than 2% as warmer forecasts for next week are dialed back slightly, and ahead of potentially-bullish EIA storage report at  10:30am ET . "The latest short-term temperature forecast was slightly more supportive than the previous several days projections," says  Dominick Chirichella  at DTN. For the upcoming EIA report, a WSJ survey of traders is expecting, on average, an unseasonal 1B cubic feet decline in storage last week that would reflect a cold autumn that's quickly boosted demand toward winter-like levels. Inventories last year at this time rose by 42 bcf, while the 5-year average is a 30-bcf injection. Gas's front-month contract rise 2.5% to  $2.66 /mmBtu. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

11/14/2019 13:13:49,TROV positive phase 2 results
11/14/2019 13:18:32,left my computer for like a second and ugaz shat itself again

11/14/2019 13:23:26,Why are you guys asking NG to push before the report lol you should ask for it to drop so you can dip buy
11/14/2019 13:23:42,only so i can sell my shares
11/14/2019 13:25:14,<@525795786001219585> funny shat itself

11/14/2019 11:54:22,Gapped from the negative report
11/14/2019 11:56:13,That's the plan. Holding on tight. Was a roller-coaster yesterday. The sell off early afternoon was pretty steep and suddenly for 10 minutes the stock was just hammered and my stop losses kicked in.

11/14/2019 12:46:55,NVDA should beat but already priced in and question next q guidance - CEO always screws it up
11/14/2019 12:47:14,<@347753927514521610> should be a 7% move
11/14/2019 12:47:19,im keen to take 5% of it
11/14/2019 12:47:30,ACB should be positive too
11/14/2019 12:48:09,NVDA should be positive but CEO is a mess of a speaker
11/14/2019 12:48:48,what are you basing that on Danson just curious you finding something in the filings
11/14/2019 12:49:04,or recent news and analyst reports
11/14/2019 12:49:13,ACB should beat I agree - pricing is good

11/14/2019 09:25:48,I took your advice danson and have been taking smaller positions and papertrading and I’ve been more confident/ making consistent Green Day’s
11/14/2019 09:29:49,<@573220750161346560> when things go to shit it’s not too bad
11/14/2019 09:30:02,When things go your way you can always add more

11/14/2019 10:22:11,Morning
11/14/2019 10:26:07,There was some serious slippage in UGAZ over night. It's not matching up to the same price of NG that it was yesterday? Or am I just seeing things?

11/14/2019 11:03:33,Morning, nice meet you all. Has anyone used Tastyworks platform before? TOS is not available here in UK so some of the vids on the course are harder to follow

11/14/2019 03:52:27,doubt is ur biggest enemy
11/14/2019 03:52:29,😦
11/14/2019 03:53:32,That true
11/14/2019 03:55:18,Nothing is going up or down.  it will be decided by candles, pattern, news, report. Buy which everyone is buying. But at support level and don't become a greedy. Take 1%-2% profit and go away and come back tomorrow for trade
11/14/2019 03:57:04,should see a reject on ugaz in the morning
11/14/2019 03:57:28,but it is a bull flag so an uptrend the day after ?

11/14/2019 01:20:29,Hey, is my first year trading, and I am doing quite well, can anyone tell me how much do we pay tax (percentage, 15% or 28% or is 15% federal and 28% state)? I am from MA and on track to make around 100,000 at end of the year.
11/14/2019 01:27:33,<@223043248715726849>  wow that insane for a first year 😄
11/14/2019 01:28:19,Damn...I'd say you're doing quite well too.  Check out YouTube video by zip Charlie called how traders can legally avoid 50% + taxes.  There are some good pointers.  It's at least a starting point

11/14/2019 01:34:50,🕺
11/14/2019 01:35:18,I like your optimism I was thinking 17
11/14/2019 01:35:29,And that was wishful thinking on my part
11/14/2019 01:35:59,But then again who the hell knows what she has in store for us!

11/13/2019 23:03:39,Will be 2 years in January. June-July I was up over 100% and then it got to my head and I started taking some wreck-less trades but since then I’ve started journaling every trade and I’ve gotten back on tract <@497078307695755264>
11/13/2019 23:05:38,My problem is chasing gains after losses.  I have a hard time letting go.  I feel like if I throw some more more at it I can catch up and break even which isnt the case most of the times.  I need to work on accepting my stop loss.
11/13/2019 23:07:18,hey that sounds like me, just buy more at a lower price. then before you know it your bag holding
11/13/2019 23:07:25,<@462090277725929472> that’s awesome! I’m up currently but it’s been a while since I’ve journaled, I should start that again
