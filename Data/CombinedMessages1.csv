In the third quarter, Altice USA showed an EPS of $0.12, compared to $0.04 from the year-ago quarter. The total market value of Altice USA's outstanding shares is at $19.7 billion.

Is that probably the reason? I cover losses too early and don't let the trade play out with cash,<@643846250323771413> thats sometimes it. usually when i'm ondemand trading it always results in an instant profit with in minutes and i just lock in. but real trading i somehow end up taking a quick loss right away,thats why i think ondmenad fills you at the best price, when entering and exiting, its like it maximizes the profit for you.,mmh. thats not good. For me its the hesitation, missing the entry or then cutting my losses too early or too late; or exactly at the wrong point. Risk management, Ricky mentioned that once or twice... 🤦‍♂️,yeah im not sure what it is. because i'm trading exactly the same on both. i'll time my entries well and very conservatively, a little past confirmation. and i think by then, in real trading, i get filled with a crappy price and it leaves no margin so it sells off. but ondemand likes to instantly fill you at what you want so i get it at a good deal, leaving better margin,<@188061790192664585> im down little 500 lol,Boy did I miss out today! Overall Ended the day down $105 with a $60 gain on UWT. But going back on my UGAZ trade yes I did miss out a lot on how it played out but this was before the quick change of direction!

However, now both are much closer together after the GFS lost 10 HDD’s compared to its run 24-hours ago, while the European model gained 10 HDD’s. It’s difficult to know if the nat gas markets will be disappointed the GFS backed off or if they will be satisfied the gained European demand. Or maybe they offset?  The early morning 6z GFS data added some demand back, which could have aided the morning spike.  Today’s trade could again bring wild swings as the nat gas markets digest mixed overnight weather trends, while positioning for another risky weekend to hold where a gap open should be expected in the direction of temperature trends.,Weather maybe,<@643846250323771413> u still holding dgaz ?,This got posted 20 minutes ago,http://www.mercurynews.com/letter-a-day-will-come-when-theres-no-natural-gas-to-be-had-in-california,LIKE I SAID EVERYONE UGAZ TO THE MOON,Ugaz finally 😂,yep.

"The latest short-term temperature forecast was slightly more supportive than the previous several days projections," says  Dominick Chirichella  at DTN. For the upcoming EIA report, a WSJ survey of traders is expecting, on average, an unseasonal 1B cubic feet decline in storage last week that would reflect a cold autumn that's quickly boosted demand toward winter-like levels. Inventories last year at this time rose by 42 bcf, while the 5-year average is a 30-bcf injection. Gas's front-month contract rise 2.5% to  $2.66 /mmBtu.
